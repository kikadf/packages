representing the overall network state. When attempting to negotiate
an address you get a nice animation. A notification bubble is also
shown per interface state change. A drop down menu shows available
Access Points, which one your connected to, if they're encrypted or
not and their overall quality. You can click on one to configure
the PSK or WEP key 0 for it.
