Enlightenment is the graphical desktop shell from the Enlightenment project.
It resembles a traditional UNIX/X1 style desktop by design but has a range
of add-ons, as well as a different core design philosophy.  Enlightenment
manages windows and files. It's a compositor and is also capable of launching
applications, handling the user interface and even system settings.
