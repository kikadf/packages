+# "normalize" Cargo.toml files for maximal compatibility
+# with all versions of Cargo and also rewrite `path` dependencies
+# to registry (e.g., crates.io) dependencies.
+#
+# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml
+# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).
