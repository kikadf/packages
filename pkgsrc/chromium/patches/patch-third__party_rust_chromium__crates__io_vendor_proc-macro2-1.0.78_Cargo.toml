+# to registry (e.g., crates.io) dependencies.
+#
+# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml
+# will likely look very different (and much more reasonable).

-# Our doc tests depend on quote which depends on proc-macro2. Without this line,
-# the proc-macro2 dependency of quote would be the released version of
-# proc-macro2. Quote would implement its traits for types from that proc-macro2,
-# meaning impls would be missing when tested against types from the local
-# proc-macro2.
-#
-# GitHub Actions builds that are in progress at the time that you publish may
-# spuriously fail. This is because they'll be building a local proc-macro2 which
-# carries the second-most-recent version number, pulling in quote which resolves
-# to a dependency on the just-published most recent version number. Thus the
-# patch will fail to apply because the version numbers are different.
