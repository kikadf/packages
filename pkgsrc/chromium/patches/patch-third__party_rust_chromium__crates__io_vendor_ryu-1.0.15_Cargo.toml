+# If you are reading this file be aware that the original Cargo.toml

-# Use smaller lookup tables. Instead of storing every required power of
-# 5, only store every 26th entry, and compute intermediate values with a
-# multiplication. This reduces the lookup table size by about 10x (only
-# one case, and only f64) at the cost of some performance.
